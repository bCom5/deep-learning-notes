# Unsupervised Learning
* representations are really important

* depth defines representations

## Deep Learning to Learn Features

* aka self-supervision, create your own supervised label

## Why Self-Supervised Learning

* expensive to label data. hiring humans
* animals and babies can self label

## Denoising Autoencoders

* different noise
    * gaussian noise
    * masking noise
    * salt-and-pepper

* have to know window, color

* L2 loss, blurry  being a little wrong (blurry) better than really bad in single place

* doesn't do that well

## Predicting Color

* L2 regression to classification

## Split Brains

* Getting better

## Contrastive Methods

## Contrastive Predictive Coding

![](https://i.imgur.com/p7hPNrF.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/Zs5V3QI.png)

* lots of noise but some info
* we want high level semantic information

![](https://i.imgur.com/Zs5V3QI.png)

* classify real and fake future?

![](https://i.imgur.com/fDsFnac.png)

* predict in the future

![](https://i.imgur.com/MnWspwt.png)

* high level vs low level

## CPCv2

* masked
* patches

## Learning via Interaction

* forward and inverse


## Questions
* CPCv2 what are negatives
