## Security and Adversarial Environments

* The Training Data is like the Testing Data

* Using a little adversarial noise
    * Fast Gradient Sign

* Optimization, minimize divergence (prebutation) but change the classification
* Easy if you have the network!

## Autonomous Driving

* Changes

* Use a mask and now can disguise it?

* To print, the color has to be printable. Sample from the color space

* Fast use only sign of gradients

* Zero-Query Attack
    * Can't try it out
* Query Based Attack
    * Make queries and estimate the attack

* Try to attack but Ensembles are an effective defense

* Low Transferability

* Try many models and try to make a single adversarial example to be effective against all models

* Use a positive and negative, find the finite difference
* Finite Difference is really good,
PCA is really good
* want low number of queries

Another option is to use GANs.

* Averaging, Ensembling,
